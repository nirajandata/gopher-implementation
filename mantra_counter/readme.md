# Utility app which I created for a very personal purpose

``` Since I don't like non-single binary files, so I always try to make a single independent binary file unless the extra file is too large```
### Btw, there are 2 different independent apps
- For Golang, #embed is used
- For C++, I converted the jpeg file to XPM file format to embed the file (I used ImageMagick to convert the jpeg to XPM)
